## Learning Path

```
1. Start with "What is LLD?" to understand the big picture
2. Master SOLID principles - foundation of good design
3. Understand relationships (Is-A, Has-A)
4. Learn Design Patterns (Creational → Structural → Behavioral)
```

## Quick Reference - Design Patterns

| Category | Patterns | Focus |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Creational** | Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory | Object Creation |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Facade, Composite, Bridge | Class Arrangement |
| **Behavioral** | Strategy, Observer, State, Command, Template, Iterator | Object Interaction |

## Key Goals of LLD
1. Write **clean, readable** code
2. Make code **flexible and maintainable**
3. Make code **easy to test**
4. Follow **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
5. Apply **SOLID** principles
