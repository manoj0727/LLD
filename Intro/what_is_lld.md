LLD(Low Level Design)
it majorly focus on classes and objects within the system

types
hld,lld,actual code

goal of lld is to 
1. write clean code
2. code should be flexible and maintainable
3. code should be easy to text

all pattern solve specific problem
we have to understand those problem already solved
for example you have to design parking patern you are comming with solution 
so knowing patern is ok but things are not repeative thats matter 

   categories are
   1. Creational
      -> it control the object creation
      -> various type of creational patterns are
      singleton
      builder -> complete object complete in different steps
      factory
      abstract factory
      object pool
      prototype

  2. Structural
      -> it focus on how different classes are arranged together so that the bigger problem ca solved flexible in most flexible way
     various pattern are
     1. decorator
     2. proxy
     3. composite
     4. adapter
     5. bridge
     6. facade
     7. flyweight

  3. Behavioral
     It focus how different object interact and communicate with each other
     how skelton behave is all guided by behavioral pattern

  various pattern
  1. state
  2. stratogy
  3. observer
  4. chain of responsibility
  5. template
  6. iterator
  7. interpreter
  8. command
  9. visitor
  10. mediator
  11. memento
  12. null object

Has-a and is-a-Relationship

is-a = this is nothing but an inheritance

vehicle -> is a 2 wheeler , is a 4 wheelar

has-a = showa a link between 2 objects
house has rooms
library has books

association -> general term for has-a relationship

weak relationship (aggregation)
it knows about it don't add or remove any 

strong relationship (composition)
existance of one object is dependent on another
also take care creation and managing 

here you need complete code like machine code 

many companies not provide code so you need to know about uml

so we have to code also 
instead of remembring so always going has-a relationship because it has parent child relationship

so go with uml 

that it
