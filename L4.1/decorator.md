so in this if we have to add more features we have to add more features
f1+f2+f3+f4+....
its kind of loop

use case of real time 
ex. pizzaa shop -> order bakes pizza we can add on that mussroom, vegetable, cheeze and many more on that 
so we decorate the object like pizza + extra cheese or we can add more and more just like a for loop it never end anytime we add anything 
it will itself a object we can decorate that object also 


decorator follow has-a and is-a relation both
