how to approach this type of question 
1. Rough Flow
   Vehicle at entrance gate what he see parking spot parked his car than make payment than he out of area

   How many entrance are there ?
   it should be scalable means in future there is more entrance than it should be scalable

Different type of spot?
-> 2 wheeler 
-> 4 wheeler 

objects 
1. vehicle
2. entrance gate
3. parking spot
4. exit gate

hourly based charge? minimum 

now let jump to lld above is rough work flow
there is two approaches
1. top/down
   parking spot
   id :int
   isempty : boolean
   vehicle  : vehicle
   int price

   park vehicle(vehicle){
   vehicle = v;
   isempty = false
   }
   remove Vehicle(){
   vehicle = null;
   isempty() = true;
   }
   twoWhelerSpot
   price(){
   return 10;
   }
   fourvechicle_price(){
   return 20;
   }

   Parking spot manager
   PS manager(list){
   list = list;
   }
   find parking space();
   add parking space();
   remove parking space();
   park vehicle();
   remove vehicle();


   two wheelar manager is responsible for two wheeler
   four wheelar manager is responsible for four wheeler

   parking stratogy ->
   near to entrance or near to elivator or default

   now method is recall find space
   so this stratogy is to find pattern
   
   vehicle has -> int vehicle number
                   VT vechicle type
    getPM(vehicle type){
    PM object
   }
   on vehicle type basis we return two wheeler object and
   entrance it has factory
   find space on basis(vehicle)
   vehicle type object has two wheeler object so it send parking stratory

   we can use heap to find nearest to entrance

   price stratogy
   hourly basis or monthly basis
   2 yearly based price used
